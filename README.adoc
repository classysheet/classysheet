== What is Classysheet?

An *object to spreadsheet mapper* that converts Java (or Kotlin) objects
to (or from) a spreadsheet, such as Google Sheets or Excel.
It can be customized through class annotations.

== How does it work?

. Annotate your domain classes or records with an `@Sheet` annotation:
+
----
@Sheet
public class Shift {
    private String id;
    private LocalDateTime start;
    private LocalDateTime end;
    private Employee employee;
    ...
}
----
+
If another sheet uses it, add an `@IdColumn` annotation on a field:
+
----
@Sheet
public record Employee(
    @IdColumn String name,
    long age,
    double cost) {}
----

. Export it to Excel:

. Or Google Sheets: 
+

+

== How do I use it?

. Create a class to wrap all data that goes into the workbook:
+
----
@Workbook
public class Schedule {
    private List<Employee> employees;
    private List<Shift> shifts;
    ...
}
----

. Once, when bootstrapping your application, create the `ClassysheetService` singleton:
+
----
ClassysheetService<Schedule> classysheetService = ClassysheetService.create(Schedule.class);
----

. To import/export data from/to a spreadsheet, use a read/write method on the `ClassysheetService`:
+
----
Schedule schedule = ...;
classysheetService.writeExcelTmpFileAndShow(schedule);
----

*Note*: reading is not yet supported.

Take a look at the examples:

- link:examples/hello-world-java/src/main/java/org/classysheet/examples/GoogleSheetsExample.java[Java to Google Sheets hello-world]
- link:examples/quarkus-java/src/main/java/org/classysheet/examples/quarkus/rest/ClassysheetResource.java[Quarkus Java (Excel)]

[NOTE]

The **Google Sheets example** requires you to provide a Google Sheets API key and grant the necessary permissions. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Create a Project in Google Cloud Console**
   - Go to the link:https://console.cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Console].
   - Click on the project dropdown and select **New Project**.
   - Enter a project name and click **Create**.

2. **Enable the Google Sheets API**
   - Within your project in the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
   - Search for "Google Sheets API" and click on it.
   - Click **Enable** to activate the API for your project.

3. **Create Credentials**
   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click on **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
   - Follow the prompts to configure the consent screen and obtain your credentials.
   - Download the credentials JSON file.
   - **Don't forget to add the emails of some users (including yourself) to enable testing.**


4. **Configure Your Application**
   - Navigate to the `GoogleAuthorizeUtil.java` file located at:
     
    
     src/main/java/org/classysheet/core/impl/provider/google/GoogleAuthorizeUtil.java
    
     
   - Open `GoogleAuthorizeUtil.java` in your preferred code editor.
   - Locate the following lines:
    
    
    
    private static final String CLIENT_ID = "";
    private static final String CLIENT_SECRET = "";
    
     
   - Replace the empty strings with your actual `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` obtained from the Google Cloud Console. For example:
     
     
     private static final String CLIENT_ID = "your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com";
     private static final String CLIENT_SECRET = "your-client-secret";
     
     
   - Save the changes to `GoogleAuthorizeUtil.java`.

5. **Authorize Access**
   - When you run the example, you'll be prompted to authorize access to your Google account.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to grant the required permissions.

== FAQ

=== Is it free to use for commercial use?

Yes, it's Apache Software License 2.0.

=== Why did you name it Classysheet?

_Classysheet_ stands for _Java class and spreadsheet_:

- `class` is short for `Java class`
- `y` is Spanish for `and`
- `sheet` is short for `spreadsheet`

=== Really?

No, not really. We just wanted to use the phrase "_It's really Classysheet!_" in a presentation.

We also considered naming it _Sheetify_, but the phrase "_Let's sheetify it!_" didn't quite work.
